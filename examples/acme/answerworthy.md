## Scope

- coverage: full
- market: Germany
- language: de-DE
- buyers: small regulated teams choosing analytics software without a dedicated compliance specialist
  - provenance: researched
- alternatives:
  - BigDash — provenance: observed
  - MetricsCo — provenance: researched
- non-fit: enterprises requiring governance controls Acme does not provide
  - provenance: supplied

### QF1 — choose analytics software for a small regulated team without dedicated compliance staff

- decision: select an analytics product the team can deploy and govern with limited internal compliance expertise
- provenance: researched
- query variants:
  - "Welche Analytics-Lösung eignet sich für ein kleines reguliertes Team ohne Compliance-Spezialisten?" — provenance: researched
  - "einfache datenschutzkonforme Analytics für kleines Team" — provenance: inferred
- material criteria:
  - supported controls and regulatory context — provenance: researched
  - deployment and onboarding effort — provenance: supplied
  - team size and expertise required — provenance: researched
  - pricing and contractual commitment — provenance: observed
  - limitations against enterprise alternatives — provenance: inferred

## Outcomes

- **O1 — QF1:** An answering system can correctly determine whether Acme is a defensible fit over BigDash and MetricsCo for a small regulated German team, and support every consequential stated reason from the public corpus.
- **O2 — QF1:** When a buyer requires enterprise governance controls Acme does not provide, an answering system does not present Acme as the better fit.
- **O3 — QF1:** If an answering system mentions Acme's onboarding-time advantage, it states the supported scope and limits rather than repeating "40%" as a universal fact.

## State

### S1 — Access to decision-useful commercial information

condition: reachable
state: verified
evidence:
  - homepage, product, pricing, and documentation were reachable without an access challenge through the declared Web test paths — verified 2026-08-14
  - decision-useful product and pricing information was present in the fetched content — verified 2026-08-14

### S2 — Company identity across public profiles

condition: identified
state: incomplete
evidence:
  - website and review profile use the same company and product names — checked 2026-08-14
  - two other known profiles require account access unavailable to this assessment
needed:
  - inspect the remaining profiles for legal entity, product, and location consistency

### S3 — Comparative fit behind the homepage compression

condition: understood
state: incomplete
compression: "compliance without complexity"
evidence:
  - the phrase is a useful concise proposition for people, but no public decision-grade expansion states which controls, workflows, team sizes, or trade-offs make Acme a stronger fit than BigDash or MetricsCo
  - the private deck states that Acme is not intended for enterprise governance, but this boundary is absent from the public corpus
needed:
  - Acme-validated fit, trade-offs, constraints, and non-fit against both alternatives
  - a public expansion that preserves rather than materially revises the impression created by "compliance without complexity"
  - public wording supported by evidence

### S4 — QF1 coverage in de-DE

condition: answering
state: missing
evidence:
  - no inspected de-DE surface answers QF1 across the material criteria — checked 2026-08-14
needed:
  - decision-useful QF1 coverage using validated fit, terms, trade-offs, and limits
  - a discoverable route from relevant commercial pages

### S5 — Homepage onboarding claim

condition: evidenced
state: unsupported
claim: "Reduces onboarding time by 40%"
evidence:
  - claim visible at https://acme.example/product — inspected 2026-08-14
  - the private deck repeats the figure but contains no method, baseline, sample, or limits
needed:
  - evidence appropriate to a comparative timing claim: baseline, method, sample, scope, date, limits, and exceptions
  - public wording no stronger than the retained evidence

### S6 — Independent support for small-team fit

condition: corroborated
state: missing
evidence:
  - the public review profile contains two ratings but no decision-relevant text about regulated small-team fit
  - two partner pages repeat Acme's product copy without independent observation
needed:
  - an independent source that establishes a decision-relevant fact from its own evidence or experience

### S7 — Decision evidence across relevant German surfaces

condition: distributed
state: incomplete
evidence:
  - Acme is present on one review platform and two partner sites
  - none of those surfaces carries evidence about QF1 fit, onboarding, or non-fit
needed:
  - validated decision-useful information on surfaces buyers in this scope actually use

### S8 — QF1 assistant observation

condition: observed
state: incomplete
query: "Welche Analytics-Lösung eignet sich für ein kleines reguliertes Team ohne Compliance-Spezialisten?"
provider: "<retained in observation log>"
model: unreached
mode: search-enabled
observed_at: 2026-08-14T14:00:00+02:00
locale: de-DE
context: "fresh session; Germany; no account personalisation; no preceding conversation"
runs: 1
position: mentioned
representation: incomplete
fit: uncertain
stated_reasons:
  - "Acme may suit smaller teams because it is simpler to deploy."
reason_support: unsupported
evidence_ref:
  - `OBS-QF1-2026-08-14`
needed:
  - repeated observations under declared conditions
  - comparison of each stated reason against the inspected public corpus

## Actions

### A1 — Validate Acme's QF1 fit and non-fit

advances: [O1, O2]
serves: [understood, evidenced]
state: waiting-human
needs: [human]
why: the public corpus cannot support a correct comparative decision until Acme validates which differences matter and where they stop applying
done_when:
  - decision-relevant differences, trade-offs, constraints, and exclusions are documented against BigDash and MetricsCo
  - each consequential distinction has evidence or remains explicitly unsupported
  - Acme approves the business-side facts and boundaries
verify:
  - compare every approved statement with retained evidence
  - test whether the same facts support O1 and reject Acme under O2

### A2 — Resolve the onboarding-time claim

advances: [O3]
serves: [evidenced]
state: waiting-human
needs: [human]
why: "40%" can change a buying decision and is currently unsupported
done_when:
  - Acme publishes sufficient evidence, narrows the claim to what the evidence supports, or removes it
verify:
  - refetch the claim and evidence
  - repeat the affected QF1 observation and inspect the stated reasons

### A3 — Create the decision-grade QF1 expansion in de-DE

advances: [O1, O2]
serves: [understood, answering, evidenced]
state: blocked
needs: [agent, human]
why: the concise proposition may remain concise; the missing work is a public explanation of the fit, terms, trade-offs, and limits, but publishing before A1 and A2 would make unsupported positioning more legible
done_when:
  - the public corpus covers QF1 using approved distinctions, terms, trade-offs, and limits
  - the expansion preserves rather than materially revises the impression created by the concise proposition
  - the explanation remains intelligible when encountered away from its original page
  - relevant commercial pages provide a discoverable route to it without becoming unnecessarily verbose
verify:
  - refetch the published material
  - compare the compression with the expanded explanation for consistency
  - re-observe O1 and O2 under the declared test conditions

### A4 — Establish genuine independent corroboration

advances: [O1]
serves: [corroborated, distributed]
state: waiting-third-party
needs: [human, third-party]
why: the claimed small-team fit currently exists only as self-description
done_when:
  - an appropriate independent source publishes a decision-relevant fact from its own evidence or experience
  - no incentive, scripting, or editorial control compromises independence
verify:
  - inspect the source and its provenance
  - confirm the public claim is no stronger than the source supports

### A5 — Complete the QF1 observation baseline

advances: [O1, O2, O3]
serves: [observed]
state: ready
needs: [agent]
why: one answer under one condition cannot establish a stable output pattern
done_when:
  - QF1 and non-fit questions are observed across the declared providers, modes, and repeated fresh sessions
  - every run retains date, locale, context, position, representation, fit, stated reasons, and evidence reference
verify:
  - repeat the protocol after A1–A4 materially change the public corpus
  - compare whether the Outcomes moved and whether the changed reasons are supportable

## Maintenance

- Re-read the current Standard whenever work resumes.
- Re-check when the offer, public corpus, or German market changes materially, or after 30 days.
- Re-verify done Actions before relying on them again.
- Revisit inferred Scope premises when new buyer or market evidence appears.
- Keep raw observations outside this file under stable evidence references.
